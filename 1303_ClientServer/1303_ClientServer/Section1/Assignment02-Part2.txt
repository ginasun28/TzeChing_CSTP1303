Assignment02-Part 2 (Design a Guess the Word game which will be implemented later as  a client server application)				
						
Come up with a communication protocol client and server to do the following:

Create a list of 5 words. The user will not see them, the word will random when game start.
Server should be able to random of 5 words for the client.						
Clients gets to make 3 guesses for the server E.g. "You have 3 chances to guess the word." for the server.
When clients guessed wrong word, the server will send message E.g "Your guess is not correct, you have 2 chances!"
Clients can continue to guess the word.
If clients guessed 3 times, the answer is incorrect then the server will send message E.g. "You are lost the game." 
If clients guessed correct word, the server will send message E.g "You are win!"
The game will be stop when the client lost or win the game.
